# Research on Vision Transformers and Transformer-based Models

## Transformer: Basic Foundation

Before diving into Vision Transformer, let's understand the core mechanism of Transformer:

### Transformer Architecture

Transformer was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" (2017), including:

1. **Self-Attention**: Mechanism allowing the model to focus on important parts of input data
2. **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention mechanisms operating in parallel
3. **Feed-Forward Networks**: Processing information after attention
4. **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: Helping stabilize training

### Self-Attention Mechanism

The main mechanism powering Transformer:

- Computing Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices from input
- Calculating similarity scores between Q and K: `Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V`
- Allows model to learn long-range dependencies more effectively than models like RNN/LSTM

## Vision Transformer (ViT)

### From NLP to Computer Vision

Vision Transformer (ViT) applies the Transformer architecture to image processing, introduced in the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words" (2020).

### Vision Transformer Architecture

1. **Patch Embedding**:
   - Dividing image into patches (typically 16×16 pixels)
   - Projecting each patch into an embedding vector

2. **Position Embedding**:
   - Adding positional information to patch embeddings
   - Can be learned position embedding or fixed position embedding

3. **Class Token**:
   - Adding special token (CLS) to beginning of sequence
   - Embedding of this token is used for classification

4. **Transformer Encoder**:
   - Processing sequence of patch embeddings through multiple Transformer Encoder layers
   - Each layer includes Multi-Head Self-Attention and MLP

5. **MLP Head**:
   - Converting CLS token embedding into final prediction

### Advantages of ViT

1. **Global vision**: Can capture relationships between distant regions in image
2. **Scalability**: Performance increases when trained on large data
3. **Flexibility**: Easily combined with other techniques
4. **Transfer learning**: Effective when pre-trained on large dataset and fine-tuned

### Limitations of ViT

1. **Requires lot of data**: Poor performance on small datasets without pre-training
2. **Computationally intensive**: O(n²) complexity where n is number of patches
3. **Lacks translation invariance**: Does not have inductive bias like CNNs

## Vision Transformer Variants

### DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer)

- Improves training efficiency with limited data
- Uses "distillation token" to learn from CNN model (teacher)

### Swin Transformer

- Computes self-attention in local windows (shifted windows)
- Reduces computational complexity, suitable for complex vision tasks
- Hierarchical architecture similar to CNN

### PiT (Pooling-based Vision Transformer)

- Combines advantages of CNN (pooling layers) and ViT
- Reduces computational complexity by reducing resolution through layers

### CrossViT

- Uses multiple branches with different patch sizes
- Combines information from different scales

## ViT for Image-to-Image Translation

### VQGAN + CLIP

Combining Vector Quantized GAN (VQGAN) with CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training):

1. **VQGAN**: Encoding and decoding images through discrete latent codes
2. **CLIP**: Providing guidance from text or reference images
3. **Process**: Optimizing latent codes to maximize similarity with guidance

### ViTGAN

- Using transformer architecture for both generator and discriminator
- Allows creation of high-resolution images
- Improves image quality compared to traditional GANs

### NUWA (Text-to-Image Transformer)

- 3D transformer model processing both space and time
- Can create images from text, video from images, etc.

## ViT in Style Transfer

### StyleFormer

- Using transformer to extract style features
- Learning style representation based on attention
- Applying style to content image flexibly

### StyTr² (Style Transformer Squared)

- Using transformer to separate content and style
- Self-attention helps identify important regions for style transfer
- Allows control of balance between style and content

        super().__init__()
        # Transformer-based decoder
        decoder_layer = nn.TransformerDecoderLayer(d_model=dim, nhead=num_heads)
        self.decoder = nn.TransformerDecoder(decoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)
        # Output: creating image from features
        self.to_image = nn.Sequential(
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(dim, 512, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),

            nn.Tanh()
        )
        
    def forward(self, content, style):
        # Using content features as input, style features as memory
        features = self.decoder(content, style)
        # Reshape to fit convolutional layers
        b, n, c = features.shape
        h = w = int(n**0.5)
        features = features.reshape(b, c, h, w)
        # Create image
        return self.to_image(features)

class AnimeStyleTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.content_encoder = ContentEncoder()
        self.style_encoder = StyleEncoder()
        self.decoder = TransformerDecoder()
        
    def forward(self, content_img, style_img=None):
        content_features = self.content_encoder(content_img)
        
        # If no style_img, use default style (anime)
        if style_img is None:
            # Dummy style features can be replaced with learned style tokens
            style_features = torch.zeros_like(content_features)
        else:
            style_features = self.style_encoder(style_img)
            
        output = self.decoder(content_features, style_features)
        return output
```
