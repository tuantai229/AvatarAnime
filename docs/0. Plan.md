# Development Plan for "Converting Human Photos to Anime Style" Project

## Phase 1: Review of Foundational Knowledge

### Basic Deep Learning and Computer Vision
- Review CNN, popular architectures (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet)
- Review image processing techniques (normalization, augmentation, transformation)
- Learn about image-to-image translation and style transfer problems
- Evaluation metrics

### Deep Dive into Generative Models
- Research on GAN and CycleGAN
- Learn about Diffusion models and Stable Diffusion
- Research on Vision Transformers and Transformer-based models

## Phase 2: Data Collection and Processing

### Data Sourcing
- Find datasets of real human portraits (CelebA)
- Find datasets of anime characters (Anime Faces dataset)

### Data Processing
- Preprocess images (crop, align faces, resize)
- Data augmentation

## Phase 3: Implementation of Approach 1 - CycleGAN

### Environment Setup and Code Understanding
- Set up environment, necessary libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Understand and analyze existing CycleGAN implementations
- Prepare pipeline for training and testing the model

### CycleGAN Training
- Set hyperparameters and begin training
- Monitor training process, adjust if necessary
- Evaluate preliminary results and improve the model

### Evaluation and Optimization
- Comprehensive evaluation of the model on various input images
- Fine-tune the model to improve quality
- Document the process and results

## Phase 4: Implementation of Approach 2 - Stable Diffusion with ControlNet

### Setup and Research
- Install Stable Diffusion and ControlNet
- Understand how Stable Diffusion and ControlNet work

### Fine-tuning
- Fine-tune Stable Diffusion with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Configure ControlNet to preserve identity features

### Experimentation and Improvement
- Improve output quality through parameters and conditions
- Evaluation and documentation

## Phase 5: Implementation of Approach 3 - Vision Transformer

### Setup and Research
- Set up environment and install ViT
- Understand Vision Transformer architecture and its application to style transfer

### Training and Adjustment
- Train ViT model for style transfer task
- Experiment with transfer learning techniques with ViT

### Integration and Evaluation
- Integrate Vision Transformer with other techniques
- Compare results with previous approaches
- Evaluation and documentation

## Phase 6: Comparison, Evaluation, and Deployment

### Compare and Select the Best Approach
- Compare image quality across the 3 methods
- Compare identity preservation capability
- Evaluate style diversity and consistency

### Build Demo and Complete the Project
- Develop demo interface (web-based or app)
- Write technical documentation and project report
- Prepare portfolio and showcase materials
