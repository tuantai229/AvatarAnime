# Data Collection

## CelebA Dataset (CelebFaces Attributes)

**General Information:**
- Contains 203,000 real human face images
- Data size: approximately 1.45 GB
- Images are aligned
- Includes 59 attributes for each image

**Characteristics and Advantages:**
- Diverse data in terms of gender, age, expressions, and facial features
- Images are already normalized for face position, saving preprocessing steps
- Includes accompanying metadata files:
  - list_attr_celeba.csv: contains attributes for each image
  - list_bbox_celeba.csv: face bounding box positions
  - list_landmarks_align_celeba.csv: facial landmark positions
  - list_eval_partition.csv: train/val/test split division

**Note:**
- Relatively low image resolution, which may be a consideration when converting to anime style
- Some images may not be suitable due to extreme angles or partially obscured faces

## Anime Face Dataset

**General Information:**
- Contains approximately 63,600 anime character face images
- Data size: approximately 415.18 MB
- Diverse anime styles

**Characteristics and Advantages:**
- Large number of images helps the model learn common characteristics of anime style
- Diverse in expressions, viewing angles, hair and eye colors
- Smaller file size allows faster processing during training

**Note:**
- No accompanying metadata or classification information
- Inconsistent image quality, some images may have low resolution
- Need to filter out unsuitable or poor quality images

## Challenges in Using These Datasets

1. **No paired data:**
   - No ready-made pairs of "real person - anime" corresponding images
   - Suitable for using CycleGAN (unsupervised image-to-image translation)
   - With Stable Diffusion + ControlNet, need to focus on preserving identity features

2. **Differences in face proportions:**
   - Anime faces typically have different proportions than real faces (larger eyes, smaller chin)
   - Need to build a model capable of learning this transformation

3. **Differences in expressions and viewing angles:**
   - May need to filter or classify images by viewing angle and expression to improve results
